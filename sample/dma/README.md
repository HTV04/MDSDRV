This is a very simple program to test the DMA protection
in MDSDRV.

The controls are for the most part the same as the usual
tester program. Press left/right to adjust the length
of the simulated DMA.

The music data from the previous build is used is used,
so you will need to either build a ROM from the "build.bat"
or "quickrom.bat" scripts in the base directory before
running "build.bat" in this directory.
